# Secure Password Checker Program

Welcome to the **Secure Password Checker Program**! This Python script helps create secure passwords by evaluating their strength and providing tips for improvement.

## How It Works

The program performs the following steps:
1. **User Input**: The user creates a username and password.
2. **Security Checks**: The password is checked against common passwords and its length is validated.
3. **Complexity Evaluation**: The program checks the password for:
   - Uppercase letters
   - Lowercase letters
   - Special characters
   - Digits
4. **Score Calculation**: Based on the password's length and complexity, the script calculates a score to evaluate its strength.
